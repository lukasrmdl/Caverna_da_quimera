# Chimera's Cave

Chimera's Cave is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) website for delivering news and articles focused on geek culture. This project was developed as one of my first web development projects during my time in college. The website was built using pure PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with MySQL as the database managed via MariaDB.

## Features
- **Geek-Focused Content**: Aimed at providing news and insights about geek culture.
- **Custom Backend**: Developed entirely in PHP for server-side logic.
- **Dynamic Content**: Articles and data stored in a MySQL database.
- **Clean Design**: Built using pure HTML and CSS for simplicity.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes JavaScript for added interactivity.

## Project Details
- **Technologies Used**:
  - PHP (pure)
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (vanilla)
  - MySQL database with MariaDB
  - XAMPP for local development and database management

- **Purpose**: This project served as a learning experience to explore full-stack web development with PHP and MySQL. It represents an early stage of my web development journey.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chimeras-cave.git
   ```
2. **Set Up XAMPP**:
   - Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
   - Start Apache and MySQL services.
3. **Configure the Database**:
   - Import the provided SQL file (`database.sql`) into your MySQL database.
   - Use phpMyAdmin or a MySQL client to set up the database.
4. **Run the Application**:
   - Place the project files in the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation.
   - Access the project via your browser at `http://localhost/chimeras-cave`.

## Notes
- **Learning Project**: This project reflects my early experience with web development and is intentionally simple.
- **No Frameworks**: All functionality is implemented without the use of external frameworks to enhance learning.
